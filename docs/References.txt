Modules could not be linked if java.modularity.inferModulePath = false



Declaring module dependencies
There is a direct relationship to the dependencies you declare in the build file and the module dependencies you
declare in the module-info.java file. Ideally the declarations should be in sync as seen in the following table.
Table 4. Mapping between Java module directives and Gradle configurations to declare dependencies

    Java Module Directive 	    Gradle Configuration 	    Purpose

    requires                    implementation              Declaring implementation dependencies
    requires transitive         api                         Declaring API dependencies
    requires static             compileOnly                 Declaring compile only dependencies
    requires static transitive  compileOnlyApi              Declaring compile only API dependencies

Gradle currently does not automatically check if the dependency declarations are in sync.
