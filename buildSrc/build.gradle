// See Use buildSrc to abstract imperative logic
// The directory buildSrc is treated as an included build. Upon discovery of the directory, Gradle automatically
// compiles and tests this code and puts it in the classpath of your build script. For multi-project builds
// there can be only one buildSrc directory, which has to sit in the root project directory. buildSrc should be
// preferred over script plugins as it is easier to maintain, refactor and test the code.
